1) Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?

allplayers = Player.all

allplayers.each do |player|
  puts player.team.name
  puts player.team.mascot
  puts player.team.stadium
end

TOTAL QUERIES = 499 (1 to get all players and 498 to get all players info so 498+1)

2) Retrieve all players and write a program to loop through each player and their team name, mascot and stadium using .includes. How many queries have we done now?

allplayers2 = Player.includes(:team).all

allplayers2.each do |player|
  puts player.team.name
  puts player.team.mascot
  puts player.team.stadium
end

TOTAL QUERIES = 2 (1 to get all players and 1 to get all players info so 1+1)

3) Retrieve all players from the 'Chicago Bulls' by using .includes

allplayers3 = Player.includes(:team).where("team.name = 'Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)

4) Retrieve all players along with the team name that play at the 'Staples Center'

allplayers4 = Player.joins(:team).select('players.*', 'teams.name as franchise', 'teams.stadium as stadium').where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'")

5) Retrieve all teams that have any player that start their name with the letter 'Z' by using .includes and .joins

allteam = Team.includes(:players).where("players.name LIKE 'Z%'").references(:players)
allteam2 = Team.joins(:players).where("players.name LIKE 'Z%'")
